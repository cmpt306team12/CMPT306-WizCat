---- About ----

The game WizCat was created during Fall 2023 semester for CMPT306, in the final year of my Computer Science degree at the University of Saskatchewan. This game was a joint effort by Andy Giang, Jean-Luc Michaud, Aaron Mee, Parker Fengstad, Christophe Gerard and myself Jesse Paterson. The original idea came from a mash up of features from the games Wii Tanks and Noita, with additional rouge-lite elements added. The project was developed in Unity, with many assets sourced from the Unity store, with the majority of the original art assets created by Andy Giang. The game can be played here: https://allahgold.itch.io/wizcat
