---- About ----

The game WizCat was created during the Fall 2023 semester for CMPT306, in the final year of my Computer Science degree at the University of Saskatchewan. This game was a joint effort by Andy Giang, Jean-Luc Michaud, Aaron Mee, Parker Fengstad, Christophe Gerard and me, Jesse Paterson. The original idea came from a mash-up of features from other games, such as Wii Tanks and Noita, with additional rogue-lite elements added. The project was developed in Unity, with many assets sourced from the Unity store, supplemented with original art assets primarily created by Andy Giang.
